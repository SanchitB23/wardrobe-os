# Engines

The domain engines are the **source of truth** for Wardrobe OS. They live in
`src/domain/**`, are pure TypeScript (no React, Supabase, AI, or I/O), and are
deterministic — the same inputs always produce the same output, with any "now"
injected explicitly. Every engine is unit-tested with Vitest (`npm test`).

AI never participates in any of these computations; it only explains their
results ([ADR-005](docs/adr/ADR-005-ai-does-not-decide.md)).

## OutfitEngine
**`src/domain/outfit/outfit-engine.ts`** → `evaluateOutfit(...)` producing
`OutfitAnalysis`.

Rule-based scoring of a set of items across dimensions — colour, formality,
season, occasion, texture, and (when data allows) weather and footwear. Each
rule returns a 0–10 score, a confidence, and human-readable
reason/strengths/weaknesses/suggestions; the engine combines them into a
weighted `overallScore` and `confidence`. This is the scoring primitive the
generation and recommendation engines build on.

## StyleDNAEngine
**`src/domain/style-dna/StyleDNA.ts`** → derives a `StyleDNA` per item.

Turns sparse item metadata into a normalised style profile: colour (temperature,
lightness, contrast, boldness, neutrality), texture (family, fabric weight, care
complexity), weather suitability per season, occasion suitability, style
(formality/professionalism), and compatibility (versatility, travel/commute
friendliness, a `protected` flag for scuff-prone pieces). Every item is
analysable via safe fallbacks. Downstream engines consume Style DNA, not raw
fields. See [ADR-003](docs/adr/ADR-003-style-dna.md).

## WardrobeHealthEngine
**`src/domain/analytics/WardrobeHealthEngine.ts`** → `WardrobeHealth`.

Scores overall wardrobe health plus per-category, per-occasion, and per-season
sub-scores, and surfaces strengths, weaknesses, **gaps** (missing staples), and
**duplicates** (over-owned clusters). Calibrated to the owner's profile.

## UsageAnalyticsEngine
**`src/domain/analytics/UsageAnalyticsEngine.ts`** → `UsageAnalytics`.

From wear logs: total wears, most/least worn, never-worn and stale items,
recently worn, per-category and per-occasion usage, optional cost-per-wear
highlights, and text insights/recommendations.

## InsightEngine
**`src/domain/analytics/InsightEngine.ts`** → `generateInsights(context)` →
`InsightReport`.

Combines wardrobe health, usage, and purchase analytics into prioritised
insights (strength / weakness / opportunity / warning / action), an overall
summary, and top actions/warnings/strengths — the data behind the Insight Center.

## OutfitGenerationEngine
**`src/domain/generation/OutfitGenerationEngine.ts`** → `generateOutfits(...)`.

Assembles candidate outfits from the wardrobe (respecting slots, eligibility,
and Style DNA compatibility) and scores each with the OutfitEngine, returning
ranked `GeneratedOutfit`s. Deterministic and bounded for performance.

## UnifiedRecommendationEngine
**`src/domain/recommendation/UnifiedOutfitRecommendationEngine.ts`** →
`recommendUnifiedOutfits(context, options)`.

Merges **saved** outfits and freshly **generated** combinations into one ranked
list: normalises scores, dedupes, applies eligibility and favourite caps and
recent-wear penalties, and attaches per-recommendation debug (rejection reasons,
penalties, boosts). Runs against the assembled `RecommendationContext`
([ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-recommendation-context.md)).

## IntelligenceOrchestrator
**`src/domain/orchestrator/`** → `orchestrate(request, context, options)` (RFC-005).

A deterministic composition layer: resolves capability dependencies (topological
order + cycle detection), runs each capability's engine with failure isolation,
and returns an `ExecutionReport`. It composes engines only — no business logic,
never calls AI, and engines never call each other. See
[ENGINE_GRAPH.md](ENGINE_GRAPH.md).

## LifestyleEngine
**`src/domain/lifestyle/`** → `planLifestyle(input, options)` (RFC-006).

Plans a trip deterministically by composing the engines across a time horizon:
expands the trip into days, selects each day's outfit by requesting the
`recommendation` capability **through the orchestrator** (never directly),
derives a capsule, packing list, laundry schedule, and — via the `acquisition`
capability — shopping suggestions for missing items. Returns a `LifestylePlan`
(TripPlan / PackingPlan / LaundryPlan / ShoppingPlan + planScore +
packingConfidence + tradeoffs + warnings). Weather is a normalized input behind
a vendor-neutral `WeatherProvider` (Open-Meteo + manual).

## AI Tool Router
**`src/ai/tools/`** — not a domain engine, but the bridge that lets the AI stylist
use the engines above **through services** rather than querying data.

- **ToolRegistry** — holds `AITool`s and emits Gemini/OpenAI tool declarations.
- **ToolExecutor** — validates model args against each tool's JSON schema, runs
  it, and returns a structured result (never throws to the model).
- **ToolRouter** — routes one or many tool calls (concurrent, isolated) and
  exposes the provider definitions.
- **Wardrobe tools** (`src/ai/tools/wardrobe`) — 8 tools
  (`getRecommendations`, `getWardrobeHealth`, `getUsageAnalytics`,
  `getInsights`, `getOutfit`, `getItem`, `searchInventory`, `getShoppingAdvice`)
  that call feature services, which call the engines/repositories.

Flow: `model → ToolRouter → ToolExecutor → AITool → service → repository →
Supabase`. See [ADR-007](docs/adr/ADR-007-ai-tool-calling.md).
